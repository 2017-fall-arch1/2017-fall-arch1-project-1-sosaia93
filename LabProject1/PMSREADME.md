			 	          by Sosa, Isaias


This program uses Binary Search Tree that adds and displays the information entered which are names for the personnel management system.

The folder contains:

1) Code that implements a Binary Search Tree and the code that runs the program.
2) It also has a header file being use for the code

When testing the program, it gives different options, such as add, delete, and display names. 
In addition, it provides an exit option to finish the program.

This folder contains the following files: Sosa-Isaias-PMS.c, BSTree.h, BST.c, and Makefile.

To compile:

 $make
To test it, try:

$ make Sosa-Isaias-PMS
To delete binaries:

$ make clean


Things to note:

The delete, and read from a file options do not work properly as planned.
